# Todo / Done List 
React project that shows a `todo list` that you can move to the `done list`, you can also add new elements to the `todo list`, and move elements back to the `todo list` from the `done list`.

To run this you need a http server I recommend using: [http-server](https://www.npmjs.com/package/http-server)
